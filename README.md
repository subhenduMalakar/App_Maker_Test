# Site Configuration and Data Files

This document outlines the key files in this project that can be edited to configure the site and manage its data.

- **`src/config/siteConfig.json`**: Contains site-wide configuration settings, such as site title, description, and other global options.
- **`src/pages/`**: This directory contains the individual files for static pages like "About", "Contact", and "Privacy Policy" (`About.tsx`, `Contact.tsx`, `PrivacyPolicy.tsx`). Edit the content directly within these `.tsx` files.
- **`src/data/directoryData.json`**: Contains the data for the directory listings. Edit this file to add, remove, or modify directory entries.
- **`src/blog/blogData.json`**: Contains the data for blog posts. Edit this file to add, remove, or modify blog content.

By editing these files and the files within the `src/pages/` directory, you can customize the site's appearance, content, and data without needing to modify the core application code.
